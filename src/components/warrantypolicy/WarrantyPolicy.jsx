Gas venting regulations and other construction restraints limit the effectiveness of these caravans against dust and water penetration. Under no circumstances should these caravans be exposed to water crossing at or above body floor level.</p>
        <p>We strongly recommend towing at a safe speed according to travels conditions with extra care and attention required on uneven surfaces. Our off-road caravans are not designed for hard impacts or heavy landing or severely rutted roads or tracks.</p>

        <h2>CHECKLIST TO MAINTAIN YOUR CARAVAN</h2>
        <p>To make sure that our caravans are safe to use and run on the roads, it is essential that we regularly check key components of our caravan and practice important routines just like how we take care of ourselves, our cars, and our homes. This very simple practice can prevent expensive damages or repairs and furthermore can extend the life of your caravans and maintain quality. To warrant any claims, please ensure the measures highlighted below are adhered to carefully and to ensure your safety while towing.</p>
        <h3>BRAKES AND TIRES</h3>
        <p>The running gear of your caravan is a crucial component to be consistently checked and it is recommended to be checked at your general service center every 10,000km or in 4 months, this usually depends on whichever one comes first. The main components to look out for in this system are,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>With your tires check to see if there are any damage or inconsistent signs of wear and tear such as cracks or unusual bulges. Pressure should also be checked and the compliance plate will state the correct pressure at the tire should be maintained. Also, make sure to check the rims for cracks or bundles and then tighten the wheel nuts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CHECK ALL SEALS</h3>
        <p>All external and internal seals should be regularly inspected. A seal with the smallest split should not be ignored as over time this little opening can cause expensive damage and repairs. It is recommended that after giving your caravan a detailed wash and clean inspect for any damages as this will help to expose areas that are not visible when dust or dirt is present.</p>
        <p>When a damaged seal is found, we advise that you do not go over the area with silicone or any other seals. This can create further damage and worsens the problems. If you are not experienced with sealing, it is recommended that you take your caravan to the nearest repairer.</p>
        <p>During your routine service for your caravan, you can also request a seal condition report. This will give you peace of mind to have the caravans checked by an experienced professional.</p>
        <h3>GAS, ELECTRIC AND WATER</h3>
        <p>Routine inspection of the water, electricity, and gas is important and this also includes testing the appliances connected to these. During testing, we want to ensure that there are no leaks and that they are working properly. Such as, emptying out water from the water tanks frequently. When it comes to inspecting the gas and 240v electricity testing or any repairs should be given to a licensed professional. It can be a dangerous process if you are doing it yourself.</p>
        <h3>RUST AND MOULD</h3>
        <p>Rust and mould will be experienced by many caravan owners as it is common. It can be an expensive process to restore if action is not taken early.</p>
        <p>Rust occurs when exposed to moisture and some key tips to prevent dust are;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid accumulation of mud or dirt on the exterior and interior of your caravan.</li>
          <li>Rust that is built up from the surface should be removed from metal surfaces.</li>
          <li>Resurface and peel or chipped paintwork.</li>
          <li>Investing in a caravan cover can prevent build-up; however, make sure to dry out the cover after rain and avoid humidity. When the caravan is not in use, make sure to store the caravan in a dry area.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>WHAT TO DO WHEN IT IS NOT RUNNING?</h2>
        <p>It is highly recommended to give your caravan a run when not traveling, the damage is greater than not having your caravan regularly cleaned. There are certain components that we need to keep in mind, such as the suspension, bearings, and axles. These components may stiffen over time, and applying grease won't help these components to move freely. Another component is the idle batteries in your caravan; when they are not in use, it can drain the batteries and create permanent damage. New batteries can be expensive, and to prevent this, it is advised to plug the idle batteries into a battery management charger or system. It is also suggested to test your batteries before traveling to ensure that they hold a charge.</p>
        <h2>WHAT ARE THE BEST STORAGE OPTIONS FOR YOUR CARAVAN?</h2>
        <p>If your RV is used for short trips and is kept in storage for a long time, make sure to have a suitable undercover area; this can help to enhance the life cycle of your caravan. Furthermore, a covered area can help to prevent unnecessary damage such as falling dangers, wear and tear, and other dangers. If you do not have an undercover area, another great option is a caravan cover.</p>
        <h2>HOW CAN I CLAIM WARRANTY?</h2>
        <p>Once we receive a claim, the claim will be accessed through photos/videos or in-person inspection if required to review the validity of the claim.</p>
        <p>If the claim is valid, we will request a few quotations from a service center for further inspection or for the repair to be carried out after authorization is given by Deluxe Caravans to cover the costs.</p>
